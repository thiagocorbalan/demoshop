# DemoShop
This project aims to show all my knowledge in the Angular that I acquired in the last 3 years. Simulating a payment screen, I show how I organize my files, components, modules, and services to communicate between components and an API.

In this project I make a point of using SASS as a preprocessor and 2 very famous libraries in the market that help us a lot on a daily basis, they are Bootstrap (Twitter) and Material which is from Angular team itself.

Every detail of this project has been carefully thought out and programmed with great care so that everything is perfect and meets the expectations of the Bexs team.

### Getting started

This project has been configured to start with just 2 clicks or 2 basic commands at the command prompt. But for this to be possible, NODE and NPM must be installed.

- Install [NODE and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

#### Start with 2 clicks
- Double-click the **START_LAUNCH.bat** file.

#### Start with 2 commands
- Run ```npm install -g @angular/cli``` to install the Angular CLI
- type `npm start` at the command prompt of your choice

- Finally go to url [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)

You need to access the URL above, but the messages must be at some point to load it. So, wait with the browser open while the project is loading.
