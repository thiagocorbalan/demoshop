# DemoShop
This project aims to show all my knowledge in the angle that I acquired in the last 3 years. Simulating a payment screen, I show how I organize my files, components, modules, and services to communicate between components and an API.

In this project I make a point of using SASS as a preprocessor and 2 very famous famous libraries in the market that help us a lot on a daily basis, they are Bootstrap (Twitter) and Material which is from Angular team itself.

Every detail of this project has been carefully thought out and programmed with great care so that everything is perfect and meets the expectations of the Bexs team.

### Getting started

This project has been configured to start with just 2 clicks or just 1 basic command at the command prompt. But for this to be possible, NODE and NPM must be installed.

- Install [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

#### Starting the app with 2 clicks
- Double-click the **START_LAUNCH.bat** file.

#### Start with 1 command
- type `npm start` at the command prompt of your choice

- Finally go to url [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)

You need to access the URL above, but it may take a while for the app to appear. Wait a moment please :)

## Final considerations and important

First of all, I apologize if my English does not like them and has errors. I confess that I'm not very good, but I try my best.

As soon as I got the test, I thought it was easy because it was in a mockup layout, but as soon as I started programming, I realized that leaving the layout exactly as requested was more than an obligation, it was an obligation. and with this strength and determination I made sure not to leave a little detail, so all the layout I made with HTML and CSS elements, without inserting image, the only images that could not be reproduced with HTML and CSS was the logos of the cards. , main logo and icons. An important detail was that I was able to reproduce almost faithfully the card with only HTML and CSS using a variety of new and old layout techniques as well.

I had a hard time getting the layout right in the right proportion using the bootstrap grid, so I realized that it would never be reproduced faithfully and I wouldn't be happy with the result, so I had the idea of ​​using the **css grid** to achieve the expected result.

I confess that my biggest difficulty was more in reproducing the layout faithfully than the programming ** NODE ** and ** ANGULAR **. That's because I recently designed a payment screen project, where I've had a lot of trouble solving the field validation issues, of how I would pass the completed form data on the card, make this communication between __Client x Server__.

However, I hope you enjoy it, just as I am very grateful to have participated in this very important and enjoyable challenge. 

Thank you and see you next time! :)
